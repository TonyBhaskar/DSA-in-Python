## Algorithms

### Searching Algorithms

- **Linear Search**: A basic search algorithm that scans each element in a list sequentially.
- **Binary Search**: An efficient search algorithm for sorted lists, dividing the search interval in half each time.

### Sorting Algorithms

- **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element, partitions the list into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-python.git
    cd dsa-python
    ```

2. **Run the Algorithms**:
    - Navigate to the desired algorithm's script file.
    - Run the Python script to see the algorithm in action.

    ```sh
    python linear_search.py
    python quick_sort.py
    ```

3. **Modify and Test**:
    - Feel free to modify the algorithms or add new ones.
    - Test different inputs and observe the performance and results.
